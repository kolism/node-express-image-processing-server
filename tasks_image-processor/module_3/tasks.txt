TASK 5:
Chain a call to resize off of gm, passing in 100 as both the first and second argument.

TASK 6:
Chain a call to write off of resize, pass in workerData.destination as the first argument.
The second argument should be an anonymous function.

TASK 7: 
Pass error as the argument to our anonymous function.
Inside the function body, check if error is truthy. If it is throw the error.

TASK 8:
Also inside the function body, make a call to parentPort.postMessage. Pass in an object literal with a key
of resized and the value true.

TASK 9:
Inside the monochromeWorker.js file within the api/src directory require gm from the gm module.
Require workerData and parentPort from the worker_threads module.
Make a call to gm, passing in workerData.source.

TASK 10:
Chain a call to monochrome off of gm.

TASK 11:
Chain a call to write off of monochrome, pass in workerData.destination as the first argument.
The second argument should be an anonymous function.

TASK 12: 
Pass error as the argument to our anonymous function.
Inside the function body, check if error is truthy. If it is throw the error.

TASK 13:
Also inside the function body, make a call to parentPort.postMessage. Pass in an object literal with a key
